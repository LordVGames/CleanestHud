# CleanestHud

This is a revival & continuation of HIFU's CleanerHud mod, with permission. (proof at bottom of readme)

## Info
- Pretty much everything about the hud has been edited in some way.
- Bugs from the original CleanerHud mod are fixed.
- Utilizes your survivor's color throughout the hud.
- - This doesn't just include the one you're playing as, but any survivor you're spectating.
- Supports modded UI from [Starstorm 2](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/) and [LookingGlass](https://thunderstore.io/package/DropPod/LookingGlass/).
- Many parts of the hud are configurable.
- - You can use [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/) to configure these settings in-game.
- If a survivor you want to play with doesn't work well with the hud, there's a blacklist you can add them to to prevent the hud from doing changes
- Lots of modded multiplayer sessions were played while this was being developed, so I've made sure it works in multiplayer

Many elements of the hud are also configurable Most are for the hud in general, but some are for the survivor specific hud elements that seeker and void fiend have!

<sub><sup>also this isn't a finished release since i know there's still a few things that don't fully work, I just wanted to get this out since everything's like 90% working</sup></sub>

## Bugs/Suggestions
This isn't a finished release, so there's likely bugs that I've either already found or haven't yet found. If you do find a bug, or have a suggestion for the hud, either make a github issue here or ping me (lordvgames) in the RoR2 modding discord server.

## Known Issues
- Some hud elements are still edited when a survivor is added to the mod's blacklist
- Changing resolutions mid-stage doesn't re-scale the hud
- - Kind of a vanilla issue, especially when going from a big resolution to a small one, but I feel it should still be mentioned



## <sub><sup>and yes, i did get permission to continue the mod</sup></sub>
